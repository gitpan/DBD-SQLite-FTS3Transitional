DBD-SQLite-FTS3Transitional

Starting from version 1.31, C<DBD::SQLite> uses the new, recommended
"Enhanced Query Syntax" for binary set operators in fulltext FTS3 queries
(AND, OR, NOT, possibly nested with parenthesis). 

Previous versions of C<DBD::SQLite> used the
"Standard Query Syntax" (see L<http://www.sqlite.org/fts3.html#section_3_2>).
Applications built with the old  "Standard Query" syntax,
have to be migrated, because the precedence of the C<OR> operator
has changed.

This module helps in the migration process : it provides a function
to automatically translate from old to new syntax.
